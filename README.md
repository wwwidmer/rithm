Getting started:

- Create a virtualenv in Python3
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
- (If not included)
  - cd static
  - npm install
  - npm run build

Navigate to localhost:5000 and start rating jokes!



I honored the six hour (ish) time limit so I missed two things:
- I didn't include up/down counts in the UI
- I didn't include an additional query for the UI to tell you if you've already voted
